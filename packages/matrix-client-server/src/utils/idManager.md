__IdManagerImplementation Summary__


The IdManagerclass, which is designed to generate unique, sequential IDs for various streams in our system. A key design decision was to use a single-writer approach, simplifying the concurrency management compared to a multi-writer setup. __THIS IS NOT A FINAL CHOICE__ but was done to develop a simpler version at first.

**Key Features**

Mutex for Concurrency Control: The async-mutex library is used to guarantee that ID generation is thread-safe, preventing race conditions by ensuring that only one process can generate an ID at a time.

**Potential Enhancements**

__Run in Transaction__: To enhance security and ensure atomicity, the getNextId method could be wrapped in a database transaction. This would prevent partial updates and ensure that the ID generation and database update are committed together.

__Usage of the stream_positions table__: 
For the moment there should be only one entry for each stream name, which gives the last stream_id used. Nevertheless for safety issues we decided to use a MAX query when retrieving the stream position in getStreamPositions. Surely there is a way to make this better.

We only use one writer for the moment so we are not using the column "instance_name" from the stream_positions. We set it to "default" by default.
